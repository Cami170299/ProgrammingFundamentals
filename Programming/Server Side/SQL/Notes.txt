										 SQL


Get or install a DataBase.

	Option 1. One of the easiest ways to get a database is to register for a shared hosting account. If you go to hostgator.com and enter the code 
	“onemonthcode,″ you’ll gain access to a MYSQL database for only $0.01 (for the first month). Once you’re in the 
	control panel (or cPanel) click the option to create a new database. Then, click on “PHPMyAdmin” for access to your  	MYSQL database.  to learn more. 

	Option 2.A alter. instead of hostgator.com is "Mamp", you run everything localy.

Get Data to play with (DataSet)
	
	After setting up My SQL, you can run a DataSet importing the information for free 
	(Related documentation: https://learn.onemonth.com/the-complete-guide-to-learn-sql-in-just-15-minutes-for-free/)

											WHAT IS SQL

SQL is a Structured Query Programming Language, (Basically is the language we use to manipulate data in a database.) 
SQL is a hybrid language so is basically 4 languages in 1

1. Data Query Language (DQL)
	Is used to Query the data base for information.
	Get information that is already stored.

2. Data Definition Language (DDL)
	Used fo defined database schemas. (Structure of the DB )

3. Data Control Language (DCL)
	Used for controlling accessing data in the database.
	User & permission managements.(Control the accessibility of the users for each DB or Data table.)

4. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
	Used C.R.U.D.       (CRUD stands for: Create, Read, Update & Delete.)

										WHAT IS A DATABASE

A data base is any type of related store information.

Structure

Data Base (DB) —> Tables —> Data, Id, Information, etc...

Types of DBs:

	1) Non-relational DB (noSQL / not just SQL)

	Is any type of DB that is not a relational DB.

		- Key-Value Stores
		- Documents (JSON, XML, etc)
		- Graphs

	2) Relational DB (SQL)

	Organize data into one or more tables:
	
		- Each table columns and rows 
		- A unique key identifies each row. 

In order to manipulate a Relational DB we need a (RDBMS)


										RELATIONAL DATA BASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)


A DBMS is a  (Relational Data Base Management system) as the same as MySQL there is multiple RDBMS such as:

	- SQLite
	- PostgreSQL
	- Oracle

The main functionalities of a RDBMS are:       (Note: Even though RDBMS use SQL the implementations vary from one to another.)

	- Make easier the management of large amount of data. CRUD
	- Handle Security
	- Create Backups 
	- Import and Export Data.
	- Concurrency.
	- Interact with software Languages 
		- Java 
		- Pyhon.
		- C# etc.. 

With this functionalities we can perform CRUD operations, as well as Queries.

												QUERY

A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (Written in SQL) that tells the RDBMS what information we are asking for 
(Basically something like a program.) The queries are defines to work with IDs (PRIMARY KEYS) which gather specific information 
for our requests.

Example:

SELECT employee.name, employee.age
FROM Employee
WHERE employee.salary > 30000;

What is a Primary Key

Is a value that identifies a specific row in a table.

Types of primary keys:

	- Surrogated Keys (Which is a random number. Exp. 12N0983)
	- Natural Keys(This are unique identifiers in the real world as well Exp. e-mail \\ SIN number)
	- Foreign Keys (Is a key that takes us to another tables primary key)
	- Composed key (2 Identifiers, this could be Surrogated, Natural or even Foreign keys. )

											

									HOW TO INSTALL 

First we need a DB server, so we will install our RDBMS in this case (MySQL), 

Once installed you will have to activate the command line writing : 

echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH'>> ~/.bash_profile
. ~/.bash_profile

This will activate ‘mysql’ commands.

The set your user with => 
				
				ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';    							OR 
				GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'db_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'P@s$w0rd123!';

										CREATING OUR FISRT DATABASE
Access your DB

mysql -u root -p         (<——— this is the command to access the database)   

Then to create a data base you put 

		 CREATE DATABASE DataBaseName;

To check if you created a data base use:
	
		 SHOW DATABASES

Then to modify your DB you need to write;

		USE database_name;

											CREATING A TABLE

Types of data we can store in tables

INT 						— Whole numbers 
DECIMAL(M,N)			— Store the length of national numbers in M and irrational in N exp. (2,5) = 12.45654
VARCHAR(1)				— The length of text 
BLOB					— Binary numbers (omg, videos, etc)
DATE					— format ‘yyyy-mm-dd’
TIMESTAMP				— format ‘yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss’

The comparison formats are 

		= : Equals 
		<> : Not Equal To
		> : Greater than 
		< : Less than 
		<= or >=  		

The command for creating a table:

Most important SQL Commands 

/*C.R.U.D COMMANDS*/

UPDATE - Updates data in a database
DROP - Deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - Inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - Creates a database 
ALTER DATABASE - Modifies a database 
CREATE TABLE -  Creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - Modifies a table 
DROP TABLE - Deletes a table 
CREATE INDEX - Creates an index (Search Key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index 

/*QUERIES*/

SELECT - Extracts data from a database 
FORM - specify the table
WHERE - Gives Parameters
DISTINCT - unique values
COUNT - the length of the data
LIKE - Starts ends with a specific combination.
IN() - allows you to look for multiple parameters



/*Different data types
INT  -- Exp. 1234567 
DECIMAL(M,N) -- Exp. (2,4) = 12.4566
VARCHAR(1) -- String (4) = hola.
BLOB -- Binary large data = videos photos
DATE -- 'yyyy-mm-dd'
TIMESTAMP -- 'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS'
*/

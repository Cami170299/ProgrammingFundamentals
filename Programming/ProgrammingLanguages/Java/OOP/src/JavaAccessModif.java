/*
            There is 2 cathegories 
    
    1) Access Modifiers = Controls the access level
            
            *Classes 
                    Public - The class is accessible by any other class
            *Attributes, Methods & constructors
                    Public - Accessible for all clases 
                    private - The code is accessible withi only the declared class.
                    Protected - Accesible in the same package and subclasses. (inheritance)
                        
    2) Non-Access Modifiers = Do not control the access level but provide more functionalities

            *Classes
                    final - Cannot be changed
                    abstract - The class cannot be used to create objects (Inheritance)
            *Attributes, Methods & constructors
                    final - Cannot be changed
                    static - Attributes and methods can be accessed without creating objects.
                    abstract - The class cannot be used to create objects (Inheritance)
                    transient - Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object contacting them.
                    volatile  - Te value is not cached.

JAVA

What does Java is useful for ?

 - Mobile applications 
 - Descktop applications
 - Web Applicaions 
 - Games 
 - Data base connecitons.

How to intall and set Java environment.

Source Code(.java) ======>Object Code (Binary)
			   Mac =/ Windows 

For compiling the source code to machine code is different from MacOS and Windows, so if we want a
 program to work in both we have to transcript but with Java we can with some middle step called 
 Byte Code (.class as file extension).

Source Code(.java) ===> Byte Code(.class) ===>Object Code (Binary)
					  Mac == Windows 

For implementing the Byte Code middle step we need a JVM, with is s component of a JDK

What is JDK?

A JDK (Java Development Kit) is a developer too with help to get a JRE (Java Runtime Enviroment),
 which is a bunch of libraries and Java toolkits, and also in which we will find our JVM 
 (Java Virtual Machine ).

After installing JDK we can start making our first line of code.
   
									CREATING A JAVA FILE

Once you create the file you can use [javac Main.java] <= this will compile the text into Binary

										JAVA SYNTAX

	Class 
Any line of code in java must be made inside of a "class" which always have to start with 
a Capital letter exp.

					public class Mian{

					} 

	Main method
Any class on a java file requires a main method to funtion properly. exp. 

					public class Main{
						public static void main(Satring[] args){

						}
					}

									JAVA VARIABLES

Data types

	Primitive data types
		the primitive datatypes are the ones with no additional methods

		DATA TYPES + syntax				SIZE (bites)		DESCRIPTION			
		byte var = 127;  			 			1				from -128 to 127
		short var = 13000;						2				from -32000 to 32000
		int	var = 14000000; 					4				from -2mill to 2 mill
		long var = 9000000000000L;				8				from -9mill to 9mill 
		float var = 12.3467f; 					4				6 to 7 decimal numbers (You can use "e" to have an exponential exp. float var = 13.45e4f;)
		double var = 12.39485683745d;			8				15 decimal numbers
		boolean	var = true;						1				true or false
		char var = "A"		 					2				stores a single character (You can use ASCII to representate)

	Non-primitive data types
		they are refer to an object

		- It has always a value such as [null]
		- they always strat with a capital letter. exp. => String, Array, Classes. etc...

									JAVA CASTING AND TYPES

Casting is when you assign a value to a primitive data type to another prmitive data type

	Type of casting
		Widenning => This is an Automatic process. exp
						int myInt = 120;
						long myLong = myInt;
		Narrowing => This must be an Manual process.
						long myLong = 13097L;
						int myInt = (int) myLong;

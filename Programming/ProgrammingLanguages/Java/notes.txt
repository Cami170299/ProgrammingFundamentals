JAVA

How to set Java environment.

Source Code(.java) ======>Object Code (Binary)
			   Mac =/ Windows 

For compiling the source code to machine code is different from MacOS and Windows, so if we want a
 program to work in both we have to transcript but with Java we can with some middle step called 
 Byte Code (.class as file extension).

Source Code(.java) ===> Byte Code(.class) ===>Object Code (Binary)
					  Mac == Windows 

For implementing the Byte Code middle step we need a JVM, with is s component of a JDK

What is JDK?

A JDK (Java Development Kit) is a developer too with help to get a JRE (Java Runtime Enviroment),
 which is a bunch of libraries and Java toolkits, and also in which we will find our JVM 
 (Java Virtual Machine ).

After installing JDK we can start making our first line of code.
